# ARC BOOST

To monitor the performance of my browser while coding with three.js, I created an ARC Boost. I utilize [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js), a JavaScript Performance Monitor developed by [mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob).

## How to install it?

1. Navigate to the website for which you want to track performances.
2. Right-click on its head and select "Boost this Site".
3. A panel will open. You can rename your boost and then click on "Code" and "JS".
4. Copy the code from [script.js](./script.js) and paste it.
5. Click on "Refresh to run" and it will start working.

## How to remove it?

1. Open ARC and press Shift + Cmd + M.
2. You can toggle your Boosts, or right-click on the boost you want to remove, then select "Delete".

I'm looking for a way to import the [stats.min.js](https://mrdoob.github.io/stats.js/build/stats.min.js) file without having to copy it.
